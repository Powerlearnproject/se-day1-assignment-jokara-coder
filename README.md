# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is designing developing and maintaining software systems.It enables reliable softwares that meets the users needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured programming: It empasized a clear flow in codes which was also aganist unstructured programming styles.
Object-oriented programming: It promoted reusability and better code organisations.
Modern software engineering practices: The development and operations promoted collaborations which accelerated deliveries and improved reliability


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Gathering and analysis: Gathering of functional requirements and analyzing the feasability of the system
System design: Turning of the requirements into workable solutions
Implementation: Convertion of the system design into acatual working software
Testing and debugging: Fixing of bugs and defects to ensure the software is of high quality
Deployment: Releasing the software to the production environment
Maintenance: Providing support and debudding activities to ensure the software remains functional

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Flexibility: Waterfall is less flexible since changes are difficult to accomodate without revisiting earlier stages while in Agile its highly flexible since changes can be easily made at any point of the development cycle.
Scenerio: Waterfall- Building a medical device software system where the requirements must be followed.
          Agile- Building an e-commerce website or social media platform where needs regular feature updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers: They understand project rquirements and understand the functonal requirements of the software
Quality assutance engineer: They understand requirements and work closely with business analysts to understand the functional and non functional requirements
Project manager: They ensure that the project scope is well defined which includes clarifying the work that will and will not be included in the projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: They offer advanced code editors with features making it easier to write clean (Vs Gode)
VCS: They allow multiple developers to work on the same project sumultaneously without conflicts (Git)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Degging and troubleshooting- Using automated testing frameworks to catch issues early
Time management- Breakdown the tasks into smallers management chunks
Communication- Holding regular meetings

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit- Testing individual units of the software. It ensures that each part of the code functions correctly
Intergration: Testing the interaction between different modules in sofware. It ensures thaat different components work together as expected
System: Testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements. It verifies that all components work together seamlessly
 Acceptance: Testing to ensure the software meets the users needs and expectations. It verifies that the software solves the users problem and fulfis business requirements



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the process of designing and refining input prompts for AI models to achieve the desired ouput
Imporntance- It enables better control over output where it allows users to steer the AI model towards more relevant answers



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague promt-Tell me about environment
Improved-Can you explain the impact of deforestration on the environment?
The improved prompt will yeild a more accurate answer.
